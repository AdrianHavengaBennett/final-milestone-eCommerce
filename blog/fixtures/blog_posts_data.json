That makes it much harder to learn new drumming patterns and movements. If you slow things way down (waaaaaay down) you\u2019ll have better success learning. Speed things up later, once you\u2019ve \u201cgot\u201d it.\r\n\r\nLearn To Read Music\r\nReading music seems scary at first, but it really is not as hard as you think. It is truly essential. We refuse to teach anyone here who won\u2019t learn to read\u2026that\u2019s how important it is.\r\n\r\nSeek & Find Inspiration & Passion\r\nAsk yourself \u201cwhat music do I like?\u201d Discover drummers you like. Immerse yourself in music. After all, playing an instrument is about making music, so exploring music and letting it excite you will inspire you. Passion and emotion drive the work of becoming a good musician. If you listen to any great musician tell their story, you\u2019ll notice an obsession with master musicians they looked up to and tried to emulate. Find some music and musicians that inspire you and you\u2019ll be driven to get better\u2026.you\u2019ll almost have no choice.\r\n\r\nPractice as Much as You Can\r\nThe cold hard truth is that it takes thousands of hours of practice to get really good. If you take lessons and you show up time after time without practicing, just know that you may never get that much better, or at best, you\u2019ll progress very very slowly. If you practice a lot, you\u2019ll start to see and feel yourself getting better and that will excite you. I love practicing because I love getting better and the more I can do on the drums the happier I am. See if that cycle will work for you by practicing a lot.\r\n\r\nBe Open-Minded\r\nIt\u2019s OK to like certain kinds of music more than others, but don\u2019t shut other things down completely. Maybe you\u2019ll hear something you really like in a place that you didn\u2019t think you would. Knowing different types of music and being able to play different styles will make you a more well-rounded and more skilled drummer. I didn\u2019t think I liked jazz and then I became obsessed with it\u2013all because of a good teacher.\r\n\r\nFind a Good Teacher You Respect\r\nYou can read books and watch videos online but nothing takes the place of a bunch of one-on-one private lessons with a great drummer who knows how to teach and is low on the ego quotient. Your teacher should be someone who you can go see play live in a club and then say, \u201cman, I wish I could play like that.\u201d That is what I mean by respect. If you like the way he plays, then you\u2019ll want to learn from him.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it\r\nI\u2019m probably way too serious about my drumming, but the bottom line is that when I\u2019m playing, I\u2019m pretty much always happy. Drumming is so much fun for me. So, take a step back, and let it sink in. You\u2019re playing drums! Isn\u2019t it fun? Of course it is. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. If it\u2019s no fun, you shouldn\u2019t do it. Enjoy your drumming and enjoy the process of getting better at it. It\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s music.\r\n\r\nDevelop Your Technique\r\nDon\u2019t ignore technique. It\u2019s probably the hardest thing about drumming to get right. It takes the most work and it\u2019s the most frustrating of the skills to learn. But guess what? If you have the patience and drive to develop great technique, you\u2019ll never regret spending that time. Pound for pound it will give your drumming more to draw from than almost anything else. I implore you to do this. Good technique will expand what is possible behind the drum kit in immeasurable ways.\r\n\r\nPlay with Other People\r\nDespite the fact that there are tons of videos of drummers alone in their practice rooms on the internet, you should go find some like-minded people to play music with. Music is a team sport for the most part, and you\u2019ll learn a lot by getting yourself into bands early on in your development. Don\u2019t skip this step; it\u2019s crucial.\"", "date_created": "2020-07-18T16:34:48.678Z", "product": null, "show": null}}, {"model": "blog.blogpost", "pk": 13, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "8 Great Music Destinations", "content": "I recently read a very informative post about \"8 of the best music destinations around the world\" by Danielle Kirk of contiki.com.\r\n\r\nShe wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Liverpool, Great Britain\r\nYou may have heard of Liverpool\u2019s most famous exports, they\u2019re this little band called the Beatles. The UK city lives and breathes Beatle-mania (they even have International Beatleweek once a year), but John, Paul, George and Ringo aren\u2019t the only big musical drawcard in Liverpool. Their Echo Arena has hosted countless stars and they host the Liverpool International Musical Festival. Liverpool is the home of some of Britain\u2019s finest pop music and its rich musical history makes it feel like every street and building has a story.\r\n\r\nMemphis, USA\r\nThis Tennessee city is King of music, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s the home of The King, Elvis Presley. His family home, Graceland, is worth a tour and whether you\u2019re a fan of Blue Suede Shoes or not, he\u2019s an iconic figure whose music changed the world. Sun Studio is also a must visit. This humble recording studio is where Elvis, Johnny Cash and B.B. King all recorded albums. Now that\u2019s iconic! The city has a unique musical flavour that needs to be seen to be believed. EVERYONE is always grooving. The best place for live music though is the famous Beale Street. BYO dancing shoes.\r\n\r\nBerlin, Germany\r\nGermany\u2019s capital is often applauded for its music scene. A city that comes alive at night, Berlin has some of the world\u2019s best night clubs. From the famously hard to get into Berghain, to techno nirvana Tresor, Berlin has music for every taste (and energy level), with a scene that is always evolving. Currently Berliners are into Echtzeitmusik, an experimental music that focuses on rock, pop, jazz and improvisation. There\u2019s definitely music niches and crowds in Berlin, it\u2019s just up to you which you want to explore! Rock and roll? Rave? Retro? You can find it all in this musical mecca.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans, USA\r\nJazz (at least the American kind) was said to have been created in New Orleans and one walk down Bourbon Street will have you nodding in agreement. It\u2019s one of the most-loved cities for music and hosts a lot of vibrant festivals, like Mardi Gras, the New Orleans Jazz Festival and the New World Rhythms Festival. Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Harry Connick, Jr. and Wynton Marsalis have all shaped NOLA into the soulful hot spot it is today.\r\n\r\nHavana, Cuba\r\nCuba\u2019s capital is alive with the sound of Latin music! The energetic tunes are known all over the world, but no Spotify mix can compete with how amazing it is in real life. Head to Havana to hear the unique Cuban music that is part Latin jazz, part salsa, part timba and part rumba. Every street and bar has patrons dancing to local sounds and many Cuban musicians remain locals, so you might just bump into them if you\u2019re lucky\u2026\r\n\r\nLondon, Great Britain\r\nOld London town is chock-full of iconic music buildings, sights and artists. It\u2019s been at the forefront of British music (especially the Brit-Pop movement) for decades and is STILL producing the goods today. South London has an up and coming music scene, but places like Shoreditch and Camden are still well known and loved for their influence on music. Visit Abbey Road for the iconic Beatles shot and be sure to check out the London Rock Tours for an epic look at everything music in Britain.\r\n\r\nVienna, Austria\r\nKnown as the City of Music, Vienna has been the home to classical music for decades. Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart (you may have heard of them) all had their legend start in Vienna, where they composed and performed throughout their lives. Vienna hosts an annual performance season that has classical music events all over the city. The Vienna Philharmonic is a must visit if you want to witness a world-class recital by the esteemed orchestra in the stately Wiener Konzerthaus.\r\n\r\nAustin, USA\r\nTexas has a lot of great music, but only Austin can boast the title of Live Music Capital of the World. Willie Nelson, Janis Joplin and Spoon are all from Austin, which proves that it\u2019s not all just about country tunes there. Austin also hosts some of the world\u2019s best festivals, Austin City Limits and South by Southwest. Even if you don\u2019t score a ticket to the festivals, you can always catch a beat at venues like Broken Spoke, the Continental Club and Antone\u2019s.\"", "date_created": "2020-07-18T16:40:09.610Z", "product": null, "show": null}}]
